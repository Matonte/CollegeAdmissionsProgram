See if you can get into college!

## General Disclaimer:
I tried to add features (particularly the applicants themselves) in the program to tell people about myself. Especially the type of humor and movies I am passionate about.

## Where the program is:
So far, I have a decision driver and have implemented the basic business logic and a basic proof of concept. I know what to work on a Unit test for the application and perhaps add an ENUM to handle residency. There definitely needs to be more test cases. Further, I want to work on creating a way to store the applicants (probably with a HashMap where the key is the applicant and the value is the feedback) with Core Java and admission feedback in a csv for storage in the future (Doable with Core Java).

### UPDATE: 
The next thing I want to focus on is finding a way to the Applicants out of the code and into an XML file. This will allow my program to become a pipeline that consumes XMLs of applicants and produce CSVs of results. Then, I want to focus on more testing using the JUnit framework. Finally, I want to eventually add a front end FX GUI to add more applicants.
